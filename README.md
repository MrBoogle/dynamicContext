# Dynamic context selection proof of concept for the FINCH Predictive Coder Neural Network.

To run this yourself, go to the directory of your choosing and run
```git clone https://github.com/MrBoogle/dynamicContext.git```

Open unity hub and add a new project, and select the directory you cloned this repository into. I used Unity 2020.3.14, it should work with most Unity versions.
Just hit the play button in the inspector and you'll see the context for each pixel. To fiddle around with the main program, go to Assets/context.cs
